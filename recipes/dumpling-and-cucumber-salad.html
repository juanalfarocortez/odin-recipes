            <h3>Description</h3>
        </p>
        <p> 
            Serving as a luscious, umami sauce for pan-fried potstickers, peanut sauce yet again proves itself to be the hero of weeknight cooking. The sauce needs no cooking, just some hot water to soften the peanut butter, which also helps the sauce come together smoothly. By design, it is slightly runnier than usual, allowing it to casually drape over the dumplings. Right after whisking, the sauce may look too loose, but let it sit for a few minutes as it relaxes and thickens into the perfect consistency. Frozen potstickers — which have a flat base for pan-frying — work best, but you could use other types of dumpling too, cooking them according to their package instructions. The cucumbers are smashed and then salted, which not only draws out moisture, but also tenderizes them every so slightly, delivering just the right amount of freshness and crunch.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup smooth peanut butter, well stirred</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</ls>
                <li>½ cup just boiled water (or more as needed) </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar </li>
                <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</ls>
                <li>2 teaspoons chile crisp or oil (or use amount to your liking)</li>
                <li>6 Persian cucumbers</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil or other neutral oil</li>
                <li>1 pound frozen potsticker dumplings (not thawed)</li>
                <li>Big handful cilantro</li>
                <li>Toasted white sesame seeds or chopped roasted peanuts, for topping </li>
                <li>Chile crisp or chile oil, for serving</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the sauce: Place the peanut butter, garlic and hot water into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine. (If the peanut butter separates and looks curdled, that’s OK. It will come back together after you add the other seasonings.) Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar and chile crisp and whisk again until smooth and well combined. (It may look runny, but it will thicken up as it sits.)</li>
                <li>Prepare the salad: Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and then into 2-inch lengths. Lay them cut side-down on a cutting board and, using the flat side of a chef’s knife or a rolling pin, smack the cucumbers until they break apart. Tear or cut them into bite-size pieces, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Place the cucumbers in a colander and sprinkle with a pinch or 2 of salt. Allow to sit for 10 minutes to draw out excess moisture.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes, until very hot. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil and, working in batches, add the dumplings, flat-side down, and cook until the bottoms are lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Carefully add about ¼ cup of water to the pan, just enough to cover the base of the dumplings, then immediately cover and cook until the water has evaporated, 3 to 4 minutes. (If your dumplings contain meat, cook for an extra 1 to 2 minutes, or according to package instructions.) Transfer the cooked dumplings to a plate and continue cooking the remaining dumplings. (If you prefer to steam the dumplings, see Tip.)</li>
                <li>To serve, divide the dumplings among 4 plates or shallow bowls and top with the cucumbers. Spoon over a generous amount of peanut sauce, top with cilantro, sesame seeds or peanuts and a few drops of chile crisp/oil. Serve right away, while the dumplings are still warm, or at room temperature.</li>
